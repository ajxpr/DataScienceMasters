        "1. **Increased Performance**: Multiprocessing can improve the performance of CPU-bound tasks by distributing the workload across multiple processors or cores.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Utilization of Multiple CPUs/Cores**: Multiprocessing allows you to take advantage of modern hardware architectures that have multiple CPUs or CPU cores.\n",

        "4. **Isolation and Robustness**: Each process in multiprocessing operates in its own memory space, providing isolation and independence.\n",

        " - Example: result = pool.apply(function, (input_value,))\n",

        "\n",
        "5. Terminate the pool: After you have retrieved the results and finished using the pool, it's important to terminate the pool to release system resources. You can do this by calling the close() method followed by the join() method on the Pool object.\n",
