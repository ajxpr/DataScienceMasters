        "1. **AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: EC2 is used to host the web scraping application. It provides virtual servers in the cloud where you can deploy your Flask application and run the web scraping code.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: S3 is used to store the scraped data. The data can be saved as files and stored in S3 buckets, which provide secure and scalable storage. This allows easy access to the scraped data and facilitates further processing or analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **AWS Lambda**: Lambda can be used for serverless execution of the web scraping code. Instead of deploying the Flask application on EC2, you can write serverless functions using Lambda and trigger them based on events or schedule. Lambda provides scalability and cost efficiency, as you only pay for the actual execution time of the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **AWS CloudWatch**: CloudWatch can be used for monitoring and logging the web scraping application. It allows you to collect and analyze logs, set up alarms, and gain insights into the performance and behavior of the application. This helps in identifying and resolving any issues or bottlenecks in the scraping process.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: IAM is used for managing access to AWS resources. It allows you to create roles and permissions, ensuring that only authorized users or services can interact with the AWS services used in the project. IAM helps in maintaining the security and integrity of the web scraping infrastructure."
